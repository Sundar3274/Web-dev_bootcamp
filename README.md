# Web-dev_bootcamp
# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# Welcome to Day-3 of the Web Development Bootcamp


### Today's Agenda

Today, we focused on two main objectives:

1. **Creating a Vite React App**: We started by setting up a new project using Vite, a fast build tool and development server. Vite provides a seamless development experience for React applications, making it easier to build and deploy high-performance web apps.

2. **Building a UI for the ToDo List App**: After setting up our Vite React app, we moved on to designing and implementing the user interface (UI) for our ToDo list application. This involved creating components, styling them.

### UI for the ToDo List App

Below is a preview of the UI we created for our ToDo list application.

### Structure of the ToDo List App

To give you a better understanding of how our app is organized, here is the structure of the ToDo list app. This diagram illustrates the components and their relationships within the app.
